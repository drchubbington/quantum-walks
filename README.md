# Quantum Walks

## Introduction
Quantum Walks are a variation of classical random walks, representing movement around a graph or line using a uniformly-distributed quantum coin. 
This is a topological implementation, representing movement around an octogon lattice. 
While this is a somewhat theoretical implementation, quantum walks are exponentially faster than their classical counter parts, while still simulating everything that classical walks can: 
   * Partical motion in gases and liquids
   * Brownian motion
   * Population distribution and genetic drift
   * Neuron activity
   * Perhaps even the stock market (see [the random walk hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis))

We would be remiss without giving some appreciation and recognition to all the people that have made this class the riviting learning experience it's been. Thank you to all the [Beaver Works Summer Institute](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi) staff, instructors, and TA's, for volunteering their time to give us an experience of a lifetime. We're so greatful-we couldn't have written all this without you!
